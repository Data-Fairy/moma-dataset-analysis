# MoMA(Museum of Modern Art) Dataset Analysis in Python

### Project Summary: Exploring the MoMA Dataset

In this project, I analyzed data from the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) dataset to explore techniques for summarizing numeric data, formatting strings in Python, and gaining valuable insights from data. This work helped me deepen my understanding of basic data analysis approaches, which are crucial for any aspiring data expert.

**Objective**:  
The goal of this project was to analyze the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) dataset to gain insights into artists' ages at the time of creating their artworks, understand the distribution of these ages, and develop efficient methods to summarize and present the data. This analysis was aimed at enhancing my foundational skills in Python and preparing for more advanced data exploration tasks.

**Tools & Techniques**:  
I utilized the following Python libraries and techniques during this project:

- **Pandas**: to import and manipulate the artwork gender data.
- **Custom Python Functions**: to summarize the data and format the outputs

**Key Insights or Findings**:

- Calculated the ages of artists at the time they created their works, uncovering trends in artistic productivity across different ages.
- Identified patterns and anomalies in the age distribution, providing a deeper understanding of artistic contributions.
- Developed functions to summarize numeric data and print findings in an easy-to-read format, which streamlined the analysis process and enhanced the presentation of results.
